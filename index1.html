            <p>Iâ€™m Abhishek from Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Please address me by my full name
                <em>Abhishek Singh</em> or just <em>Abhishek</em>. Whatever you feel comfortable with ðŸ™‚.</p>
            <p>My native is Satna, Madhya Pradesh, India. I can speak Hindi (mother tongue!), English.</p>
            <p>Iâ€™m currently studying BCA IPS College, DAVV University, Indore.
                Apart from studies, I spend time reading books, coding and reading articles.</p>

            <h2 id="computer-science">Computer Science and Me</h2>
            <p>I canâ€™t find a better name for this section as I think Iâ€™m not just <em>a programmer</em>. I mean, yes
                Iâ€™m one but not just one that why. ðŸ˜‰</p>
            <p>I started coding at grade 11 (11th standard in Indian terms). For me, I was attracted to computers by video
                games. After a lot of web searches, I started with Python. Now after a few years, I know Python quite
                well. I also know basics of C, C++ and Java. My personal favorite is Python and C++,
                because Python is simple and elegant and C++ is great.</p>

            <h2 id="reading-preferences">Reading Preferences</h2>
            <p>I like books on fiction. Non-fiction is fine as long as it is not boring. I also love reading books on
               Stock Market, philosophy ðŸŒŸ. Iâ€™m not an avid reader, but I try my best to complete at least one book in 2-3 month. If you
                got a good book to share, donâ€™t forget me!</p>
            <p>Reading blogs and articles is also my way of passing time. I try to read anything that is mildly
                interesting or related to Computer Science and Application.</p>
            <h2 id="contact-me">Contact Me</h2>
            <p>Feel free to contact me for any feedback, comments and chit chat. For instant reply, use Telegram, for
                classic way, use email. The links are available at Home Page of this website.</p>
